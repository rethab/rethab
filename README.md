### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

:bowtie: I'm an independent JVM (Scala, Kotlin & Java) contractor specializing in backend web development. Please contact me at (github-username) (at) pm.me for work.

:neckbeard: I tweet about AWK at [@mawkic](https://twitter.com/mawkic). More AWK stuff is in [awk-scripts](https://github.com/rethab/awk-scripts).

:nerd_face: My other interests are [Rust](https://github.com/rethab?tab=repositories&q=&type=&language=rust) and [Haskell](https://github.com/rethab?tab=repositories&q=&type=&language=haskell).
